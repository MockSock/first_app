// Now since everything is a widget, we need to create it
// Widgets are a special type of class, which come in two flavors

// Stateless, where nothing changes
// EX: A logo or a static loading screen

// Stateful, where change occurs, may it be by the app or user
// EX: A new user form that will be sent to the app or an animation
